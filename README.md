# First Game Attempt
 My first attempt at making strategy, turn-base, rogue-like game.
 It was the first game I started. The final product is not very great to be blunt.
 As my first venture into creating games I treat it mostly as a lesson.
 The appearance is not very appealing, as most art is created by myself, and I'm in no way an artist.
 I mostly focused on game mechanics & code, in which I have least contempt, looking back.

 The game in question is playable for anyone who is willing to (First Attempt - Done.exe).
 I do not plan on working on it any further, at least not in that version.
 More attempts to come..
